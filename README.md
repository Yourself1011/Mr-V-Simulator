# Mr. V Simulator

Mr. V Simulator is a first person stamper game (because g\*ns are not school appropriate). It uses a 3D engine built from scratch, which uses raycasting. Navigate through a maze, and make it to the next level, while stamping assignments with Mr. V's stamp of approval. Make sure not to let the assignments get too close! The maze generation algorithm is entirely original. Your score increases with every assignment stamped, based on your current level.

Note - the leaderboard is local to the deployment

## Controls

-   WASD to move
-   Left-click to stamp
-   Mouse to move (like a joystick - the more you move your cursor to the right, the more you constantly rotate right)
